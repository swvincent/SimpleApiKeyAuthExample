SimpleApiKeyAuthExample

Based on https://www.endpointdev.com/blog/2022/06/implementing-authentication-in-asp.net-core-web-apis/

But without the database lookup, etc. This example just uses an API key stored in appconfig

https://dotnetthoughts.net/implementing-basic-authentication-in-minimal-webapi/ was also helpful
